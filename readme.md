### Problem Name

Count Clicks!!

### Problem Statement

On the screen you can see a `ButtonCounter` (contains a button, upon clicking which the click counter increases) on the left and a `ViewportSwitcher` (a group of Mobile, Desktop buttons) on the right. On Switching between the viewport types, the width of the container for the `ButtonCounter` changes.

If you click to increment the button click count on the left, and then switch the viewport. You will see that the button clicked counter resets.

So, the task for this problem is that switching between the viewport type after clicking on the button counter, the counter should NOT reset.

Consider the following scenario:
**STEP 1**: Clicking `Click Me!` button on the left, increases the clicked count to 1
**STEP 2**: Clicking on `Mobile` button on the right should change the dimensions to a mobile view
In the new viewport view, the button clicked count should remain as 1.

## Submission Instructions

1. Clicking "Run code" will compile and run your code against sample tests, but it will not generate scores. Click on "Execution Log" to better understand the test execution.
2. Clicking "Submit code" will run your code against multiple test cases, assessing different scenarios holistically. The score will be assigned accordingly.

To access the instructions, click on the "Question" button which can be found in the bottom left corner of the screen.
