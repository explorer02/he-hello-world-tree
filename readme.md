### Problem Statement

For our FAQs screen, we need FAQ cards to be collapsible and deletable. Last FAQ will not be deletable.

FAQ Cards have already been implemented for you but its not working as expected.

To make it work, we have two requirements

**TASK 1**: Clicking + button on card should expand it
**TASK 2**: Clicking X button on card should delete it

## Submission Instructions

1. Clicking "Run code" will compile and run your code against sample tests, but it will not generate scores. Click on "Execution Log" to better understand the test execution.
2. Clicking "Submit code" will run your code against multiple test cases, assessing different scenarios holistically. The score will be assigned accordingly.

To access the instructions, click on the "Question" button which can be found in the bottom left corner of the screen.
